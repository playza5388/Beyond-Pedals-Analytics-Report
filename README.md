### Sales Trends by Product Category
- Sales are seasonal across product categories, with TOU leading at **39.73%** ($103M). Followed by ROB with **27.56%** the ORB with 25.21%.
- The least popular category is TRE, making up only **0.56%** ($1.4M) of total sales.
- In **April** of both years, sales across multiple product categories experienced significant growth, with **TRE** jumping by **1121%** (2023) and **EBI** rising by **1062%** (2024), marking a notable seasonal peak.
- In the quieter month of **December 2023**, sales distribution is more balanced across categories: TOU leads with **29.32%**, followed by ORB at **28.02%**, ROB at **22.48%**, and EBI at **18.80%**.
- In slower months, there are fewer extreme spikes or dips in demand for specific products, which results in a more stable share of total sales among the categories.

### Sales Trends Across Discount Percentage Ranges
- The most effective discount range is **3-4%**, generating **69.17%** ($180M) of total sales. This is followed by discounts **over 5%**, which contribute **18.49%** ($48M) of sales.
- Sales generated by each discount category also show **seasonal variation**.
- In months where overall sales are low across all discount categories, even higher discounts (above 5%) do not significantly boost sales volume.
- Sales across all discount percentage ranges saw a significant increase in **April** during both years.
- In the typically quiet month of **December**, sales for the discount range of **3%–4%** saw an impressive **512% increase**, but this equates to a rise from just **$31 to $190**, a negligible contribution to the month's total sales of **$3M**.

## Recommendations
### For seasonal sales management:
- Implement strategic discounts to address seasonal sales fluctuations, particularly during December and January when sales typically reach their lowest point
- Offer discounts above 5% during low-sales months to stimulate demand and increase sales volume

### For product category management:
- Phase out the underperforming product category TRE, which currently accounts for only 56% of total sales
- Specifically discontinue the FXGR1000 product line, which showed extremely low performance with just 105 units sold across 25 transactions in 2023
